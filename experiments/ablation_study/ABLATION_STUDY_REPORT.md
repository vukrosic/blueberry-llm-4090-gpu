### Key Insights

1. **Gradient Accumulation:** Reducing from 4 to 2 provides consistent improvements across all configurations
2. **Dropout Regularization:** Lower dropout (0.05 vs 0.10) significantly improves validation performance
3. **Learning Rate:** Higher learning rate (0.08 vs 0.065) shows promise but less stable than dropout optimization
4. **Model Capacity:** More experts help but have diminishing returns
5. **Combination Effects:** Not all optimizations stack well - simpler combinations often outperform complex ones

## Technical Analysis

### Gradient Accumulation Impact
- **Observation:** Reducing gradient accumulation steps from 4 to 2 consistently improves performance
- **Hypothesis:** More frequent weight updates lead to better convergence in short training runs
- **Validation:** All top 4 experiments use gradient_accumulation_steps=2

### Regularization Analysis
- **Dropout Reduction:** Lowering dropout from 0.10 to 0.05 provides the best improvement
- **Reasoning:** With limited training steps (20), less aggressive regularization allows better learning
- **Trade-off:** May require monitoring for overfitting in longer training runs

### Architecture Insights
- **Expert Count:** 12 experts vs 8 shows improvement but increases computational cost
- **Parameter Efficiency:** 20.9% vs 28.4% active parameters per forward pass
- **Recommendation:** Use 8 experts for efficiency unless computational resources are abundant
